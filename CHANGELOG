A total restructuring to this repository, adopting the new name of Anagrama.

Jun. 19, XXIV [7226356]:

- Added aphysical blending to Blur, which allows for the use of thresholds,
whereby the simulation of highlight diffusion filters is eased.  Not additive
blending.

- Created the Anamorpho program.  It simulates the anamorphic process in form
of a shader to let different effects look as they would under a real anamorphic
lens.  Writes to the backbuffer; requires two techniques: one to squeeze, the
second to desqueeze.
