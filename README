Programs for ReShade (https://reshade.me).

PROGRAMS

The Programs included in the Collection.  They are accompanied by their perfor-
mance cost in frametime, calculated at 4k resolution on an NVIDIA RTX 3070 GPU.

i. Blur [1ms]:
self-explanatory.  Blurs the image using a 6-pass dual filter blur. Can be
used for simulating lens diffusion filters.
  
ii. Hyperblur [2.5ms]:
not self-explanatory.  Blurs the image using separate passes of a dual filter
blur.  Without diving into technicalities, this means it preserves small-
scale *and* large-scale blur... with the sacrifice of it taking up about twice
the performance cost as 'Blur.'  Very, very good at simulating bloom; looks
great.

iii. Anamorpho [0.5ms]:
allows the simulation of the anamorphic process by likewise squeezing the
image, and then desqueezing the image. This allows for natural, filmic soft-
ness and for effects like bloom (hyperblur) to behave as they would with an
anamorphic lens. For experts.
